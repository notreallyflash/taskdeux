 To design a low-fidelity wireframe showing the basic user flow of a food delivery app — from the home screen to the order confirmation screen. This task helps us learn about information architecture, layout planning, and user journey mapping before adding colors or visuals.

I’ve been working on mapping out the 'blueprint' for a new food delivery app concept. I created the simple, low-fidelity wireframes to focus purely on the user's journey, making sure the flow from finding food to checking out feels logical and effortless.
